              | Geothermal energy is the energy generated by heat stored beneath the Earth's surface. Geothermal systems are one of four basic types of ground loop systems that use the heat of the earth for energy. Three of them are closed loop systems (horizontal, vertical, and pond/lake) and the  fourth type of system is an open-loop option. These geothermal systems use the constant temperature of the earth as the exchange medium instead of using the outside air temperatures which allows the system to be highly efficient on cold winter nights.

              li Heating  and air conditioning
              li Electricity generation
              li Geothermal heat pumps (Water)
            br
            p
              | Geothermal heat pumps function just like conventional heat pumps except geothermal heat systems actually transfer heat through loops of liquid-filled pipes buried in the ground. In order to determine which loop system is right for you, you must take soil conditions, available land and installation costs into consideration.Geothermal energy heats, cools and cuts fossil fuel use at home making it both efficient and economical.

              | Nationwide: The United States tops the world in geothermal energy production. Majority of the energy generated comes from the western states and Hawaii because the geothermal resources are close to the surface. California produces the most geothermal energy in the United States mostly because of "The Geysers" which are the largest dry steam field in the world. The map shown below by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows the various capacities of geothermal energy production in many areas of the United States.
            p
              | Texas: Austin, the state capital of Texas, was actually one of the first cities to use geothermal energy for heating. The layers of underground earth are usually between 54 and 67 degrees year round in Texas despite how hot or cold the temperatures are above ground. There are a few main types of geothermal systems in Texas that are available to homeowners: ground source, air source and water source. In order to install a geothermal system, you must contact local installers to discuss which type of system is suitable for your property. Tax credits up to 30% are available to homeowners in Texas.

              | The full cost of a geothermal system can range from $11,00 to $30,000. The monthly geothermal cost would on average be $173 for the power, plus $132 for the loan totalling $305. About $1900 is saved during the course of a year when comparing the payments of the geothermal system to an older system previously installed. Tax incentives are also offered to lower the costs of geothermal systems. Use the geothermal
